[Laura Bliss](https://www.laurablisswrites.com/). 2018-11-28. "[A U.S. Transit Atlas That Ranks the Best (and Worst) Cities for Bus and Rail](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/11/best-transit-american-cities-bus-rail-subway-service/576739/)".  
This article is a summary and review of [Christof Spieler](https://www.trainsbusespeople.org/christof-spieler)'s book, "[Trains, Buses, People: An Opinionated Atlas of US Transit](https://islandpress.org/books/trains-buses-people)".  
"Spieler's atlas illustrates how high-performing public transportation boils down to a handful of key tenets: the density and walkability of an area, and the connectivity, frequency, and reliability of the service. Finding the proper capacity to meet demand matters, too, as do speed and legible tools for navigating the system, he writes."

[Laramie Bowron](https://blog.goswift.ly/@laramie_44230). 2019-09-12. "[The Case for Revising Headways Policies](https://blog.goswift.ly/the-case-for-revising-headways-policies-7ddfb5ca1898)".  
"There's currently no standard in how most transit agencies measure the reliability of their [headways](https://www.transitwiki.org/TransitWiki/index.php/Headway), and it's hurting the rider experience."

[Paul Mees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mees). 2009. [Transport for Suburbia: Beyond the Automobile Age](https://www.routledge.com/Transport-for-Suburbia-Beyond-the-Automobile-Age-1st-Edition/Mees/p/book/9781849774659).  
Available at [Multnomah County Libraries](https://multcolib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1400467152).  
This book argues that the secret of 'European-style' public transport lies in a generalizable model of network planning that has worked in places as diverse as rural Switzerland, the Brazilian city of Curitiba and the Canadian cities of Toronto and Vancouver. It shows how this model can be adapted to suburban, exurban and even rural areas to provide a genuine alternative to the car, and outlines the governance, funding and service planning policies that underpin the success of the world's best public transport systems.

Levels of ridership depend on:

* Density
* Activity
* Walkability
* Connectivity
* Frequency
* Travel Time
* Reliability
* Capacity
* Legibility
* Inclusivity

Calls out Portland, OR for having poor land use with too much single house zoning, which limits the number of people who can use transit.

* The amount of time lost when transit schedules do not directly conform to work, school, or activity schedules
* Average wait times
