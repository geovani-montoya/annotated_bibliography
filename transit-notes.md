Includes maps of frequency of service against population density as a critical factor that affects ridership levels.  
Recorded presentation on 2019-10-08: [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42Fx-2v6KC0) is a 47-minute presentation in Seattle followed by 11 minutes of questions.  
Levels of ridership depend on:

* Density
* Activity
* Walkability
* Connectivity
* Frequency
* Travel Time
* Reliability
* Capacity
* Legibility
* Inclusivity

Calls out Portland, OR for having poor land use with too much single house zoning, which limits the number of people who can use transit.

[Transit Wiki](https://www.transitwiki.org/)  
[headway](https://www.transitwiki.org/TransitWiki/index.php/Headway) is the amount of time between transit vehicle arrivals at a stop. Headways have a significant impact on how desirable a transit service is because they effect:

* The time penalty for missing a train or bus
* The amount of planning and preparation needed to use transit and stay on schedule
* The amount of time lost when transit schedules do not directly conform to work, school, or activity schedules
* Average wait times

* What if we could see our own access and mobility? Discusses maps by [walkscore.com](https://www.walkscore.com/) with isochrones for what you can reach in 15 or 30 minutes from a particular point. Note: See also [OpenTransit](https://github.com/trynmaps/metrics-mvp)'s implementation of [isochrones](https://muni.opentransit.city/isochrone).
* Five essential aspects of transit:
    * Frequency
    * Span
    * Speed
    * Reliability
    * Capacity
